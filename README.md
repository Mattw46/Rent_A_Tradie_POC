# POC: Rent A Tradie:

This is a service to match Trades men with potential customers.

###### How it Works:
Customer needing trade work done places a ad (Auction) detailing the work they wish to be done.
Trades men are then able to place a big on the work, the customer is then able to view and accept or reject bids. Accepted bids require the trades man to complete the work at the price accepted.

###### Technical Details:
The platform is built on a Lamp stack using Ajax and API's to fulfill many functions.
PHP pages are used where functionality cannot easily be built with an API.


*Note:* This is a proof of concept and likely to change and evolve.
